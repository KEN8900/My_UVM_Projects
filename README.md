# My_UVM_Projects

Hello, I am Hongkuan (Ken) Yu. Welcome to the public repository of my UVM Projects. 

This public repository contains all the verification projects I learned and coded by myself. The main method is UVM, but I also apply normal simulation testbench and formal property verification methods. Please refer to the `README.md` file for more details for different projects respectively.





EDA used for simulation testbench: Synopsys VCS with DVE and Synopsys Verdi

EDA expected for formal property verification: Synopsys VC Formal or Cadence JasperGold (I do not have access to them now so just expected)

EDA used for UVM: Synopsys VCS with DVE and Synopsys Verdi

UVM Library: Mainly 1.1d
