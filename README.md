# My_UVM_Projects

This public repository contains all the verification projects I learned and coded by myself. The main method is UVM, but I also apply normal simulation testbench and Formal Property Verification (FPV) methods. Please refer to the `README.md` file for more details for different projects respectively.

- EDA used for simulation testbench: Synopsys VCS with DVE and Synopsys Verdi

- EDA used for FPV: Synopsys VC Formal or Cadence JasperGold

- EDA used for UVM: Synopsys VCS with DVE and Synopsys Verdi

- UVM Library: Mainly 1.1d
